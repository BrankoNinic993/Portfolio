### Introduction Part:
1. curve the edges using border-radius and add a little bit of shadow in the outer parts and add some padding,
2. change background color to be more similar to the one in Clickup image (explore gradients as new css features)
3. check for typos in your headings and change it to 'h1'

### Social Media Links Part:
1. create 'See my work' link to look like the one in the Clickup image (add a little bit of padding, background-color & border-radius)
2. refactor your code in '.social-networks' div because it is not very well written. First link's href attribute doesn't lead to any page and that is why we use '#' inside it if we don't wanna to make it lead us anywhere beside this page. More on that later...
3. every social media icon should also be a link to a proper URL (use '#' for now). Wrap the icon in link tag.
4. add gap between icons. Remember one of the combination the 'gap' is used with is 'flex'
