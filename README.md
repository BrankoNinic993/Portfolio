### Introduction Part:
1. curve the edges using border-radius (odradjeno) and add a little bit of shadow in the outer parts (odradjeno) and add some padding (odradjeno),
2. change background color to be more similar to the one in Clickup image (odradjeno) (explore gradients as new css features)
3. check for typos in your headings (odradjeno) and change it to 'h1' --- ODRADJENO

### Social Media Links Part:
1. create 'See my work' link to look like the one in the Clickup image (odradjeno) (add a little bit of padding, background-color & border-radius) (odradjeno)
2. refactor your code in '.social-networks' div because it is not very well written. First link's href attribute doesn't lead to any page and that is why we use '#' inside it if we don't wanna to make it lead us anywhere beside this page (odradjeno). More on that later...
3. every social media icon should also be a link to a proper URL (use '#' for now). (odradjeno) Wrap the icon in link tag.
4. add gap between icons.(odradjeno) Remember one of the combination the 'gap' is used with is 'flex'
5. re-style 'See my work' button. Make it look like rectangular with curved borders around corners. Do not forgett to add a little bit of padding from all sides. Make font larger and more readable.
6. make icons larger so it's more appealing to user's eye.

### NAVIGATION MENU
1. make menu links larger and make them change their background-color to rgb(153, 154, 158) when user hovers over it. Apply transition of 0.25s duration to hover effect.
2. add some padding to link elements. X-padding should be a little bit larger then Y-padding.
3. when user clicks on one of the link elements it should change the color of font to 'rgb(13, 223, 52)';
4. links in the navigation menu should be bolded by default.
